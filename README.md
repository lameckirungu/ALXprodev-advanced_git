# Git-Flows
<p><em>Git-Flow</em> is a branching model for Git, proposed by Vincent Driessen, that helps developers manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a consistent and scalable way. It introduces well-defined roles for branches and helps teams coordinate code changes more effectively. Git-Flow is particularly beneficial for large-scale projects where multiple developers work simultaneously on various aspects of the codebase.</p>

Git-Flow revolves around five primary branch types:
 - `main` (or `master`) - production-ready code.
 - `develop` - ongoing development.
 - `feature/*` - new features in progress.
 - `release/*` - preparation for production releases.
 - `hotfix/*` - critical bug fixes on the main branch

 ### Learning Objectives
 - Understand the purpose and structure of Git-Flow
 - Identify the different branch types and their roles.
 - Apply Git-Flow in real-world collaborative development projects.
 - Manage feature development, hotfixes, and release cycles using Git best practices.

 ### Git Flow Best Practices
 ---------------------------
 | Best Practices | Description | 
 | ---- | ---- |
| **Start with `develop `**| Always branch off of `develop` for new features, not `main`|
| **Feature Isolation**| Keep each feature in its own branch to reduce merge conflicts.|
| **Merge via Pull Requests**| Use pull/merge requests for all merges to ensure code review.|
| **Keep `main` clean**| Only production-ready code goes into `main`. Never push untested code here.|
| **Tag Releases**| Use Git tags on the `main` branch to mark official release points.|
| **Use `hotfix/*` for urgent bugs**| Apply emergency fixes directly to main via a `hotfix/*` branch and merge them back into `develop`.
| **Document your workflow**| Maintain clear documentation of your Git-Flow in your project's README or internal wiki.|
------------------------------

### Common Git-Flow Commands
```bash
git flow init                   # Initialize Git-Flow
git flow feature start <name>  # Start a new feature branch
git flow feature finish <name> # Finish feature and merge into develop
git flow release start <x.x.x> # Start a release branch
git flow release finish <x.x.x> # Merge release into main and develop
git flow hotfix start <x.x.x>  # Start a hotfix branch
git flow hotfix finish <x.x.x> # Finish hotfix and merge into main & develop
```

### Tasks
### 0. Setting up gitflow
*Objective:* Understand and initialize a GitFlow workflow. <br>
*Instructions:*
```md
- Install git-flow if not already installed. Steps [here](https://skoch.github.io/Git-Workflow/])
- Create an empty repository `ALXprodev-advanced_git`.
- Clone your repository to have it available locally.
- Create a branch develop
- Push the develop branch to the remote repository
- Initialize Git Flow within the repository using default settings i.e `git-flow init -d`
- Create an empty README.md file
- Commit your file to staging and Push
```
### 1. Creating a feature branch
a. *Objective:* Learn how to work with feature branches in GitFlow <br>
b. *Instructions:* 
- Create a new feature branch `feature/implement-login` from the `develop` branch.
- In the `feature/implement-login`, create a new directory called `login-page`, inside it create a `README.md` file with the message: `Login Feature Coming soon`
- Commit your changes and push to github.
- Use commit message `feat: scaffolding login page`

### 2. Creating a Release Branch
a. *Objective:* Understand the release process in GitFlow. <br>
b. ***Instructions:***
- Create a new feature branch `feature/implement-signup` from the develop branch and create a directory called `signup-page` with a README.md file with the message `feature coming soon`.
- Commit and push the changes.
- Merge the 2 branches to the `develop`. Fix conflicts if any.
- Create a new release branch `release/1.0.0`.
- Make changes to `signup/README.md` file by adding the following text: `" data requirements: email, firstName, lastName, profilePic]"` inside the release branch.
- Commit, push changes then merge the `release` branch to the `main` branch and the `develop` branch.
- Tag the release with `v1.0.0` and push the tags to the remote repo.
Repo:
- GitHub repository: `ALXprodev-advanced_git`
- File: `login-page/README.md`, `signup-page/README.md`
